Difference between **Factory** and **Builder** Pattern (Metapher)

### Factory:
Consider a restaurant. The creation of "today's meal" is a factory pattern, because you tell the kitchen "get me today's meal" 
and the kitchen (factory) decides what object to generate, based on hidden criteria.


### Builder: 
The builder appears if you order a custom pizza. 
In this case, the waiter tells the chef (builder) "I need a pizza; add cheese, onions and bacon to it!" 
Thus, the builder exposes the attributes the generated object should have, but hides how to set them.
